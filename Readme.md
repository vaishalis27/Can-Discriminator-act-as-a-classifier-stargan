## Adapting GANs: Can the Generator Act as a Classifier? (MNIST Dataset)

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in classification tasks, specifically focusing on the MNIST dataset. The primary goal is to adapt the generator within a GAN to function as a classifier, assessing its performance on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. Unlike traditional uses of GANs for image generation, this project investigates the novel application of using the GAN's generator for classification.

## Requirements
Before running the project, please ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
tqdm

## Running the Project
The project is fully contained within the master.py file. This script manages all steps, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## To run the project:
Make sure all dependencies are installed.
Open the Master File and execute Line by Line
This will execute all processes necessary to train the model on the MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance as a classifier.

## Project Details
Dataset: MNIST (handwritten digits, 28x28 pixels)
Model: Custom GAN architecture designed and implemented specifically for this project
Objective: Investigate the potential of the GAN's generator to classify images
The custom codebase developed for this project includes all necessary components, from data loading and preprocessing to model architecture, training loop, and evaluation metrics. This project represents an original approach to leveraging GANs for classification tasks on the MNIST dataset.
